- AVOID `try`/`catch` where possible
- AVOID `else` statements
- AVOID using `any` type
- AVOID `let` statements
- PREFER single word variable names where possible
- AVOID over complicating solutions. If you think a more complex solution would be useful, ASK FOR FEEDBACK

- When picking libraries, ASK if the ones you have chosen are OK
- PREFER making small, targeted changes, easy to review
- When naming a git branch, it should be in the format of ctrotman/{area}/{feature} - my name is `ctrotman`.
- When doing a git commit, prefer to use the format of `{short name of area}: {short description of feature}`
- Before pushing a commit to a pull request after making changes, make sure you verify your changes
